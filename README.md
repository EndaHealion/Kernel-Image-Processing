# Kernel-Image-Processing

C++ and SFML implementation of image processing using kernels.

How to use:
 * Place a .png file with the name "inputImage.png" in the location of the executable (or change the code to choose a custom location).
 * Run the executable.
 * You can find the "outputImage.png" in the location of the executable (or change the code to choose a custom location).

Notes:
 * My implementation is based off of the wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Convolution
 * The #defines are based on the example code from the wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Concrete_implementation
